# Teleporty

This ad-don adds a but-ton that teleports you to the current (or most recent) audible tab. That is, if it's still alive and doing well. Hope you took good care of it.

### How to build:
Default procedure, best done using `web-ext`.

### How to install
Double click the `.xpi` file I guess? ðŸ¤·
